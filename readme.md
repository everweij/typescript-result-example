# Typescript Result Example

This is a simple example of how you could potentially use [Typescript Result](https://github.com/everweij/typescript-result) in a web API project.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`

Check the [routes](./src/routes.ts) file to see which routes are available.
Some routes are 'protected' and require you to provide a token as a query parameter. It has the format `?token=user-{{USER_ID}}`.
